Marine automation is the integration of advanced technologies to enhance the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of maritime activities. It encompasses a broad spectrum of systems and solutions, ranging from basic process automation in engine rooms to fully autonomous navigation and control systems for ships. These innovations rely on a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robotics, sensor networks, and software engineering to perform tasks traditionally handled by human operators. For example, autopilot systems with enhanced navigation algorithms can adjust course based on real-time environmental data, while predictive maintenance tools analyze machinery performance to detect and prevent potential failures. By automating repetitive and complex tasks, marine automation not only reduces the burden on crew members but also minimizes human error, leading to safer and more reliable maritime operations.

Key concepts in marine automation include situational awareness, data integration, and human-machine collaboration. Situational awareness involves using sensors and AI-driven systems to monitor the vessel's environment, such as weather conditions, traffic patterns, and obstacles, to make informed decisions. Data integration plays a crucial role in combining information from IoT devices, onboard systems, and external sources to provide a comprehensive view of the ship's operations. Furthermore, human-machine collaboration ensures that automation supports rather than replaces crew activities, enabling operators to focus on critical decision-making tasks. These concepts are integral to the development of advanced systems like autonomous vessels, digital twins for maritime assets, and smart port operations, revolutionizing how the maritime industry approaches efficiency and innovation.
